"""Apply OPCG-Go's local fixes to the vendored engine.

`vendor/` is gitignored and recreated by bootstrap, so anything edited there by hand is lost on the
next clone. Fixes live here instead and are re-applied by `scripts/bootstrap.sh`. Each patch is
idempotent and refuses to apply blindly: it verifies the anchor text still exists and skips if the
fix is already present, so an upstream refactor produces a clear failure rather than a silent
no-op.

`patch_engine.py` is permanent, not a stopgap: Ping decided 2026-08-17 that the orderCards fix
stays local (docs/plans/encode-op15-op16.md), so these patches must survive upstream drift
indefinitely. That is what `--check` is for.

    python3 tools/patch_engine.py            # apply anything outstanding
    python3 tools/patch_engine.py --check    # report only; EXIT 1 if any patch is not applied

`--check` exits non-zero for a PENDING patch as well as a broken one, so it works as a CI gate:
an engine that merely has not been patched yet is just as wrong to test against as one whose
anchor has moved. Applying (the default) exits 0 on success -- only `--check` gates.

# --- Patch 1: the bot cannot resolve `orderCards` prompts -----------------------------------
#
# `resolveBotPromptCommand` branches on four of the six ChoiceKinds and lets `orderCards` fall
# through to `optionId = prompt.options[0]?.id`. An orderCards prompt wants a full permutation in
# `selectedIds`; a lone optionId is rejected with "Prompt resolution could not be applied", and
# runBotMatch treats one rejected command as fatal.
#
# Measured on a Block 2+ mono-green deck, 20 games:
#   stock    3/20 games completed (15%), orderCards 17 seen / 17 rejected
#   patched  20/20 completed (100%), 0 rejections, 890 prompts resolved
#
# Ordering cards *well* is a strategy question. Ordering them *legally* is not, and this is only
# the legality fix — identity order is as good a default as any until a real policy exists.

# --- Patch 2: search-to-hand is gated on open CHARACTER slots ------------------------------
#
# `effectSearchSelection` in effects/resolution.ts rejects a selection when
#   selectedIds.filter(cardType === "character").length > openCharacterSlots
# and it applies that test for EVERY search, including one whose `revealDestination` is "hand".
# Adding a card to your hand does not need a board slot, so with a full character area (0 open
# slots) the engine refuses every Character the prompt just offered.
#
# The two halves disagree, which is why this looks like a filter bug and is not one. Prompt
# creation in effects/actions.ts folds `openCharacterSlots` into `destinationCapacity` ONLY for
# `revealDestination === "character"`; resolution applies it unconditionally. The trait/name
# filters are fine -- on OP16-118 Ace the prompt's own `eligibleIds` is correct and every rejected
# card is in it.
#
# Reproduced on OP16-118 Portgas.D.Ace: 4 bodies down, Ace takes the 5th slot, [On Play] looks at
# 5, prompt marks Monkey.D.Luffy `enabled: true` and lists it in `eligibleIds`, and resolving it
# returns `accepted: false` / "Prompt resolution could not be applied."
#
# Blast radius is not one card: 171 of the 185 encodings with a `search` action reveal to hand,
# and only 19 of those are OP15/OP16. The other 152 are upstream's own cards, so like the
# orderCards bug above this belongs upstream.
#
# The fix mirrors actions.ts -- gate the slot test on the destination. The `playableEligibleIds`
# membership test on the line above still constrains a hand reveal, so nothing is loosened for
# `revealDestination === "character"`.

# --- Patch 3: the first player takes 2 DON!! on their first turn, and should take 1 -----------
#
# `finalizeBeginTurnRefresh` places `Math.min(2, player.donDeckCount)` every DON!! Phase with no
# first-turn exception, so the player going first opens on 2 active DON!! instead of 1.
#
# The rule: a player places 2 DON!! from their DON!! deck each DON!! Phase, EXCEPT the first
# player's first turn, when they place only 1. It is first-player compensation and it is the pair of
# the skipped first draw, which this engine *does* implement (`skipFirstTurnDraw`,
# Comprehensive Rules 6-3-1). Only half the compensation was there.
#
# Measured before the patch, Ace mirror, seed 7 (`turnNumber active=seat  north | south`):
#   turn 1 active=north   north 2a/0r don (8 left) hand 5   <-- first player, should be 1a/9 left
#   turn 2 active=south   south 2a/0r don (8 left) hand 6
#
# Why the condition is written this way: `state.config.firstPlayer` is authoritative by the time
# turn 1 begins -- the 猜拳 winner's `chooseFirstPlayer` overwrites the config value during setup
# (CLAUDE.md), so it names whoever actually leads. The alternative signal, `skipDraw`, would work
# today because it is true exactly once per game, but it is derived from a config flag a caller can
# switch off, which would silently take the DON!! rule with it. Turn number plus seat cannot be
# misconfigured.
#
# THIS CHANGES EVERY PLAY/DRAW NUMBER MEASURED BEFORE IT. The first player has been running a turn-1
# DON!! surplus, so the first-player advantage in docs/simulation.md is overstated by an unknown
# amount and its 8.5-point Block 2+ gap needs re-measuring.

# --- Patch 4: two upstream tests assert the pre-fix DON!! behaviour --------------------------
#
# Patch 3 makes the first player place 1 DON!! on their first turn. Two tests in
# `tests/index.test.ts` were written against the old flat 2 and fail after it. Both are correcting
# the TEST, not accommodating the fix -- they assert a state the official rules do not permit:
#
#   1. `supports accepting a mulligan...` asserts `players.south.activeDon === 2` immediately after
#      startGame. South wins 猜拳 in `startGameCommands()` and chooses itself as first player, so the
#      correct value is 1.
#   2. `plays a stage, activates it, ...` plays two 1-cost cards (Otama, then Windmill Village) on
#      south's first turn. On 1 DON!! the second play is refused, `stageArea` stays null, and the
#      test dies on `Unknown card instance: null` rather than a clean assertion. Its subject is the
#      stage's power projection, not the opening DON!! count, so it is given a turn cycle to breathe:
#      south ends, north ends, and south acts on turn 3 with 3 DON!!.
#
# Note this is NOT the `skipFirstTurnDraw` flag being off. `src/shared.ts` defaults it to
# `config.skipFirstTurnDraw ?? true`, so first-player compensation is ON in these tests -- they take
# the skipped draw and still expect the un-reduced DON!!. That is upstream encoding the bug, which is
# why patch 3 is unconditional rather than hung off that flag.
